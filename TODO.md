# TODO
---------------

## Add
1. API functions to show and hide cursor dynamically.
2. "Borderless Window" fullscreen mode.
3. API functions to lock/unlock cursor from moving outside the bounds of the window.
4. Put window origin at the center of the window on Windows.

## Fix
1. Fix fullscreen mode on WIndows being a hack rather than actual exclusive mode.
2. The moveWindow API function moves the window incorrectly under Linux.
3. When resizing under Windows, the window full shrink slightly when the window edge is first clicked.
